\title{Get the LOD value for each marker based on the correlation between genotype
and phenotype.}
\usage{
get_lod_by_cor(npheno, pheno, gdata, doGPU = FALSE)

\arguments{
\item{npheno}{The number of phenotypes present in the data set}

\item{pheno}{The extracted phenotype data from the cross object}

\item{doGPU}{Boolean, whether to use the gputools package to speed up,
mapping. This can only be set to \code{TRUE} on machines with an NVIDEA
graphics card with the gputools package installed. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{geno}{The extracted genotype data from the cross object}
}
\value{
The LOD scores for all markers
